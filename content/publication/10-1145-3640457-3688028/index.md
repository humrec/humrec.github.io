abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing
  many of our significant and minor decisions. These systems also have become integral
  to the music industry, guiding users to discover new content based on their tastes.
  However, the lack of transparency in these systems often leaves users questioning
  the rationale behind recommendations. To address this issue, adding transparency
  and explainability to recommender systems is a promising solution. Enhancing the
  explainability of these systems can significantly improve user trust and satisfaction.
  This research focuses on exploring transparency and explainability in the context
  of recommendation systems, focusing on the music domain. This research can help
  to understand the gaps in explainability in music recommender systems to create
  more engaging and trustworthy music recommendations.
